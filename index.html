                    <p>
                        Static web pages are made of “fixed code,” and unless the site developer makes changes, nothing
                        will change on the page. Think of it like a brochure for a business.

                            A dynamic website can contain client-side scripting or server-side scripting to generate the

                    <p>
                        Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond
                        to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.

                        Website templates are pre-designed layouts that allow you to arrange content onto a web page to
                        quickly create a well-designed website.

                        Creating a front end experience isn’t a one-person job. In fact, it takes a group of people to
